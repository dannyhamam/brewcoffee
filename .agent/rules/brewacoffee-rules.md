Code Style Guidelines:

1. Always use Tailwind CSS when styling components.
2. Prioritize structure over brute force. Focus on creating scalable and understandable code rather than forcing things to work.
3. User Experience takes priority over everything. All designs should be based on how to make the website look aesthetically clean.
