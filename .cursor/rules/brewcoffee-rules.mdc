title: "Cursor Code Style Guidelines"
---

1. Use Tailwind CSS for all component styling.
2. Prioritize clear structure and scalable patterns over hacks.
3. Design for user experience first—keep the interface clean and consistent.
4. Place reusable styling logic in the shared `index.css`; avoid duplication.
5. Follow existing color schemes and interaction patterns.
6. Ensure all buttons use `cursor-pointer` on hover.
